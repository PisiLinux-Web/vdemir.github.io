<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext">main is the default entry point of a C (and C++) program. The correct signature of the function is: <code class="prettyprint inline"><code class="language-cpp">int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp);</code></code><br />and in C++ it&#039;s treated as a special case, defined automatically as <code class="prettyprint inline"><code class="language-cpp">extern &quot;C&quot;</code></code> to keep the symbol name free from name mangling. (see also: <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/tpfhelp/current/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.ztpf-ztpfdf.doc_put.cur%2Fgtpa2%2Fextrnc.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 4650266);" class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="ibm.com">IBM TPF Product Information Center</a></span>).<br /><br />The compilation of a program consists of two important stages: creating the object files and putting the object files together. When an object file is created (from a .c/.cpp file compiled) it will contain a set of symbols (functions) identified by names, that are offered by that object file. Linking means putting all these symbols together; however the symbol usually called &quot;main&quot; is used to start your program.<br /><br />The <code class="prettyprint inline"><code class="language-cpp">void</code></code> there is a mistake that is ignored by the C language, and it means, usually &quot;returns 0&quot; (the standard leaves this undefined, afaik). The exit code of the program communicates the success (0) or failure (non-zero) of the program run. This can be ignored if you don&#039;t want to use your program in batch scripts, but becomes more important if you need to use it in scripts.</span>
